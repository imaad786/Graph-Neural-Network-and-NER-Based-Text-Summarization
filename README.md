# GNN and NER Based Extractive Text Summarization

This project introduces an innovative approach to text summarization, leveraging the capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems. GNNs, with their exceptional ability to capture and process the relational data inherent in textual information, are adept at understanding the complex structures within large documents. Meanwhile, NER systems contribute by identifying and emphasizing key entities, ensuring that the summarization process maintains a focus on the most critical aspects of the text. By integrating these two technologies, our method aims to enhances the efficiency of summarization and also tries to ensures a high degree relevance in the condensed content.
