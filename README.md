Welcome to the repository for our pioneering project on **Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Named Entity Recognition (NER)**-driven **text summarization**! This project addresses the challenge of distilling vast textual data into concise, contextually rich summaries without compromising core content or meaning. Using advanced GNNs and NER, we‚Äôve crafted an innovative system that interprets and summarizes complex text more effectively than conventional methods.

## üåü Project Highlights

### üöÄ The Motivation

In an era where data is exploding in both volume and complexity, effective text summarization has become a vital tool across domains. Traditional summarization techniques struggle with large, nuanced data, often leading to information loss or redundancy. We aimed to create a robust, resource-efficient system that leverages **GNN's relational understanding** and **NER's focus on key entities** to achieve superior summarization.

### üéØ Core Objectives

1. **Explore the Power of GNN + NER**: Evaluate the integration of GNNs and NER for extractive summarization, assessing if this fusion delivers on its theoretical promises.
2. **Efficiency and Accessibility**: Provide a summarization tool that operates with significantly lower computational demands than large language models (LLMs), making it accessible even in resource-constrained environments.
3. **Performance and Contextuality**: Test and validate our framework‚Äôs ability to generate summaries that are both accurate and contextually aware, capturing key relationships and entities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

Our approach integrates **spaCy's pre-trained NER** model with a carefully structured **GNN pipeline** to generate summaries from texts. The project follows a systematic process:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, cleaning, lemmatization, and dependency parsing prepare text for graph construction.
2. **Entity Identification with NER**: Identifies and emphasizes crucial entities within the text, such as names, locations, and organizations.
3. **Graph Construction & Analysis with GNN**: Uses the identified entities and text structure to create a graph where sentences and entities are nodes, and edges represent relationships.
4. **Summary Generation**: Applies graph-based ranking algorithms (like PageRank) to identify key nodes, producing a summary that retains essential content.

## üî¨ Evaluation & Testing

We used the **CNN/Daily Mail dataset** and benchmarked our model with **ROUGE metrics** for accuracy and **user feedback** for readability. Our results show promising improvements in summary quality, efficiency, and contextual retention, with potential to compete with leading LLMs in specific scenarios.

## üí° Key Findings

- **Balanced Performance**: Our model strikes a strong balance between precision and recall, ensuring comprehensiveness without redundancy.
- **Efficiency Advantage**: Compared to LLMs, our GNN + NER approach offers significant resource savings, making it ideal for use cases where computational power is limited.

## üìà Results & Comparisons

Our system was tested against prior graph-based summarization approaches and select LLMs, yielding competitive results in both **summary precision** and **content retention**. The findings suggest that our **GNN-NER integration enhances extractive summarization**, proving effective in creating concise, information-dense summaries.

## üåç Future Directions

We plan to extend this work by exploring:
- **Scalability** for large datasets or real-time feeds.
- **Enhanced GNN architectures** for even richer relational insights.
- **Improved evaluation metrics** that go beyond traditional ROUGE scores, focusing on semantic fidelity and coherence.
